# My-Simple-Text-Calculator
This is my first project, which is just a simple text calculator written in C++.

Here are some Instructions for you:
	1.We allow + - * / ! ^and miti-! calculating method 
	2.!! means like this <4!!=4*2>,!!!means like this <6!!!=6*3>
	3.You can define the val by yourself and use it in the following calculating,but it dosen't support the repeated val defination
	4.You can even calculate the value of 2.1^3.2
  5.It can not support the scentific input,so 2e means 2*e
  6.Don't put the space after the number,we considered it a error
  7.Attention :do not enter Chinese characters in the program,it has no idea about that
  8.To make it more general,we have already set pi(3.1415926) and e(2.78) for you
  9.You need to enter a ';' behind the expression to print the result
Anyway,it's a not too bad calculator,try to use it~
